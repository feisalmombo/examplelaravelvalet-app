## Original Laravel Project with Laravel Valet

Valet is a blazing fast development environment for Laravel. One of the reasons it’s so famous is because it runs without web server software (Apach and Nginx). It uses DnsMasq on Mac OS, and Acrylic DNS on Windows 10, Valet proxies all requests on the *.test domain to point to sites installed on your local machine.
